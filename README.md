# openv_challenge

# Introduction
Build a simple motion detection, which should be possible from searching the internet and reading documentation. 

# Tools
Used the following to complete the challenge:

OpenCV
Python 3
cv2 and numpy modules

# Output
There are 2 videos provided, "Motion.mp4" and "NoMotion.mp4". In the cast of the former, the script should detect motion and output a jpeg image for every bit of detected motion similar to "Example Output.jpg". In the case of the latter, the script should not detect any motion.
